Hello, and welcome!

If you would like access to the repository containing the code for computing accessibility transport poverty by public transport, please send an email to kiliantho@gmail.com so I can grant you access. Some files were too heavy to upload, so they are not included in the repository.

I am deeply interested in transport poverty, so if you are researching this topic, please let me know if you would like to collaborate or if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Kilian
